# üìà Amazon Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

This project leverages a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning model to predict Amazon stock prices based on a comprehensive set of technical indicators. The performance of the LSTM model is compared with a traditional Linear Regression model to highlight the advantages of using deep learning in time-series forecasting.

---

## üß† Objective

The goal of this project is to build a robust stock price prediction model using both traditional and deep learning techniques, and evaluate their effectiveness using standard regression metrics. It focuses on **Amazon (AMZN)** stock data fetched using the `yfinance` library.

---

## üìä Features Used (13 Total)

The model was trained on a set of 13 carefully engineered features:

- **Price Indicators:** `Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Close`, `Volume`
- **Moving Averages:** `SMA_30`, `SMA_100`
- **Technical Indicators:** `RSI`, `MACD`, `ATR`
- **Volatility Measures:** `Volatility_30`
- **Bollinger Bands:** `Bollinger_High`, `Bollinger_Low`

All features were normalized before training for optimal model performance.

## ü§ñ Models Compared

| Model             | Description                                      |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Linear Regression| Baseline model to set performance benchmark      |
| LSTM             | Deep learning model to capture temporal patterns |

## üß™ Evaluation Metrics

| Model            | RMSE | MAE   | R¬≤ Score |
|------------------|------|-------|----------|
| LSTM             | 4.28 | 3.213 | 0.9855   |   
| Linear Regression| 5.69 | 4.45  | 0.9707   |

The LSTM model significantly outperformed the Linear Regression model in all evaluation metrics.

# üìç Predicted vs Actual Close Price (Next Day)

After training the model on 150 days of data, we tested it on completely **unseen 151st day** to simulate a real-world next-day prediction.


### üî¢ Result:
üìç Predicted Close Price: 195.16
üìç Actual Close Price: 194.95
> This highlights how the model performs on completely unseen real-world data.
> üß† Model was off by only **‚Çπ0.21**, showing high generalization capability even beyond the test set.
